OrmTest - Object Relation Mapping Testing

 What is it?

  OrmTest is a java framework for easy JUnit 4.9+ testing of object-relation mappings in projects that use
  Spring-based DAOs. OrmTest eliminates the need to create spring contexts during transactional tests.
  This way tests run much faster and are much simpler.
